# sink to enable during debugging
# for example, to debug random_netdevice transform or norm_event generation process, put its component name in the inputs list
# also note that there is vector tap (https://vector.dev/guides/level-up/vector-tap-guide/) which can be used for debugging

# sinks:
#   stdout:
#     type: console
#     inputs:
#     - transform_random_netdevice
#     - norm_event_random_netdevice
#     target: stdout
#     encoding:
#       codec: json
